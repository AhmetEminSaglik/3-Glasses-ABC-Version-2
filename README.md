# 3 Glasses Problem A, B, C
There are 3 totally similar glasses and a robot/machine. They are decided by people which of them are A, B, or C. Robot/Machine does not know which of them is A, B, or C.

The robot/machine is requested to order them as the user want.
For example, a user wants glasses stacked as C, A, and B.
There are loops as entered by the user. For example, the robot/machine tries to order the glasses as randomly 100 times.
Then statistics are calculated about how much of them are stacked as requested. 
After Robot selects and puts the glasses every time, the user approves or ejects its movement.  

Average correct order in Version 1  is 16%.<br>
Average correct order in Version 2  is 40%.
